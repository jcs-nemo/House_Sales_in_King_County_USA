# House_Sales_in_King_County_USA
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. In this assignment, I analyse and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on.
